## üçì  WEEK 01

1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
This is one of my top favorite operating systems introduction videos. 
I've learned so much from it, the presenter did a really good job of breaking down what is operating systems.
This video is the must watch for people who want to learn operating systems for the first time.

2. [Computer Basics: Understanding Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkGCLIQx1MI)<br>
This video is for the people who likes colorful and a lot of animation. 
They explain the basics of operating systems with full of animation! That's cool

3. [How Do Operating Systems Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNp0bBrjmU)<br>
Same as number 2, this video is full of animation.
But I think this video much better than the other one because there's more explanation.
This video helped me learning operating systems, 
so you guys definitely must watch this vid!

## üçì  WEEK 02

1. [Introduction to C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPjZKsUYSXg)<br>
At first, I don't have any idea what is C programming.
But, after I watched this video, I understand the explanation of C programming.
Big thanks to this guy!

2. [Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-cybersecurity)<br>
I really recommended this to all people who want to learn Cybersecurity.
Big kudos!

3. [Protection and Security in Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKb7KhfoZmU)<br>
This video helped me learning protection and security in operating system, I recommended you to watch this!

## üçì  WEEK 03

1. [Filesystem Organization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-organization-in-dbms-set-1/)</br>
file system or filesystem (often abbreviated to fs) is a method and data structure that the operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved.

2. [Files & Directories in Operating Systems: Structure, Organization & Characteristics](https://study.com/academy/lesson/files-directories-in-operating-systems-structure-organization-characteristics.html)</br>
This course helped me to understand what is filesytem organization

## üçì  WEEK 04

1. [The Linux System](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/)</br>
From OS10 Chapt-09 i learn Linux is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system's hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work

2. [Memory Map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT5XMOrid7Y)</br>
memory map is a structure of data (which usually resides in memory itself) that indicates how memory is laid out. The term "memory map" can have different meanings in different contexts.

## üçì  WEEK 05

1. [Windows 7 and BSD UNIX](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/)</br>
From OS10 Chapt-10 I read some information about Windows 7 and BSD UNIX. Windows 7 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft. The Berkeley Software Distribution or Berkeley Standard Distribution[1] (BSD) is a discontinued operating system based on Research Unix, developed and distributed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley. The term "BSD" commonly refers to its descendants, including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonFly BSD.

2. [Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlH4-oHnBb8)</br>
In computing, virtual memory, or virtual storage is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine" which "creates the illusion to users of a very large (main) memory".

## üçì  WEEK 06

1. [Process Synchronization](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/)</br>
From OS10 Chapt-03 I learn some information about Process Synchronization. Shortly, Process Synchronization is  is the task of coordinating the execution of processes in a way that no two processes can have access to the same shared data and resources.

2. [Memory Management](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/)</br>
From OS10 Chapt-04 I learn some information about Memory Management. Shortly, Memory Management is Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory, assigning portions called blocks to various running programs to optimize overall system performance

3. [Process Mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7g8vWv11Vk)</br>
The process map is a tool that graphically shows the inputs, actions and outputs of a process in a clear, step-by-step map of the process. This is tollgate # 3 of Define in the DMAIC.
