1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)</br>
This is one of my top favorite operating systems introduction videos. 
I've learned so much from it, the presenter did a really good job of breaking down what is operating systems.
This video is the must watch for people who want to learn operating systems for the first time.

2. [Computer Basics: Understanding Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkGCLIQx1MI)</br>
This video is for the people who likes colorful and a lot of animation. 
They explain the basics operating systems with full of animation! That's cool

3. [How Do Operating Systems Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNp0bBrjmU)</br>
Same as number 2, this video full of animation.
But I think this video much better than the other one because there's more explanation.
This video helped me learning operating systems, 
so you guys definitely must watch this vid!
